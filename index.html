    <h3><span class="white"> Aspiring </span> Software Engineer </h3>
    <p>Hi, I’m Priyansh! I’m a passionate Computer Science student who loves turning even the smallest ideas into impactful solutions. My journey with coding started back in high school, and since then I’ve been creating projects that bring my ideas to life.
    I specialize in web development and game development, with hands-on experience building interactive web apps, coding in Java and Python, and developing engaging games in Godot. There's this one project that might seem simple, but for me, 
    it was a life-changing step in realizing the power of what I can build, more on that below. When I’m not coding, I’m usually exploring new technologies, learning new languages, or experimenting with fun side projects to sharpen my skills.

            This is one of projects that I am the most proud of what it really is just a stock list app where the items you need are all there
            so as you look through this site you can see the items included from dry stock to freezer stock and all you need to do is input the stock and 
            either click sumbit list or click master sumbit list to see the full checklist where you can mark everything of.
